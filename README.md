he data has been already split to training and test sets. Use those sets accordingly.

Task Description: Provide your own model on image classification using given dataset. You need to try 4 model and compare their performance.

1- Model 1: CNN model with only 2 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. You’re free to use your own choice of activation functions.

2- Model 2: CNN model with 5 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. You’re allowed to use only sigmoid function as activation function.

3- Model 3: CNN model with 5 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. You’re free to use your own choice of activation functions.

4- Model 4: Resnet-18 model. (You are allowed to import the model from model zoo of DL libraries but don’t use pretrained weights.)

Hint: You are allowed to add pooling, batch normalization, and flatten layers into suitable places in your Model 1, 2, 3 architectures.

Feel free to try different optimizers and loss functions or hyperparameters. But remember to use same hyperparameter set, optimizer and loss function when comparing results of the models.

You’re allowed to use your preferable DL library (TF, Keras, Pytorch)

Experimental Study Framework: Use 5-fold cross validation for each model that you have been trained and report the average accuracy for each of them.

Model Performance Evaluation Metric: Report your model’s p
